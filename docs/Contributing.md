# Contributing

Socket is an open source project, open to receiving new PR features and issues being filed. 

Version 1 of Socket was developed by just [me](https://github.com/JoelBrd) - I'm hoping that people will love this tool and want to add things to it, to make a powerful as possible tool for power users in Roblox Studio!

## Todo List

### Planned
This a list of features that we want implemented into Socket:

- Prompt undeclared fields in a popup screen (as a separate UI element, outside of the Widget)
- Global `IsRunning`, so if a teammate starts running a Macro on their client this will also be indicated on your client (and you can stop running it)
- `IsDangerous` option, that will require a confirmation click before running `Function`
- Make Roact/Rodux logic cleaner (Socket was [my](https://github.com/JoelBrd) first time using Roact and Rodux!)

### Ideas
This is a list of features that are being considered to be implemented:

- Saving/Loading of Macros across multiple Studio places
- Refresh button on the Widget to reload the Plugin
